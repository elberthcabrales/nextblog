                  <p>My name is Filip Jerga and I am an experienced software engineer and freelance developer. </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and several years of experience working
                    on a wide range of technologies and projects from C++ development for ultrasound devices to
                     modern mobile and web applications in React and Angular.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have acquired advanced technical knowledge and the ability to explain
                    programming topics clearly and in detail to a broadÂ audience. I invite you to take my course,
                    where I have put a lot of effort to explain web and software engineering concepts in a detailed,
                    hands-on and understandable way.
